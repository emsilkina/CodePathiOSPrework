# Prework - Profile App

Submitted by: Emily Silkina

Profile App is an app that displays my information and contains my name, current university, dream job, and headshot. There is a button to change the background color, 
and a text field option to rename the university I attend.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Snapchat
- Sending random photos to your friends and being able to edit them by adding text or stickers on top
- Chats disappear if they aren't saved
- Seeing my friend's Bitmojis on the app to see their locations

Spotify
- Creating albums of my favorite music
- Being able to view the current music that is playing on my homescreen as well as being able to skip over songs without entering the app

## Notes

The most challenging aspect was creating a textfield with an accompanying button such that the university name is updated when the user clicks the button.
